# Final Project Template

## Description: 

## MyCloset- a website where you can log in the contents of your closet and item value, then remove items as you clear out or donate clothes. It tabulates the value of the clothes (if you want to do a tax write off for a donation) and can also perform a search for the nearest Salvation Army or donation center based on location.
